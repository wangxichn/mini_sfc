.. module:: gui_topology
  :platform: Linux
  :synopsis: This module serves static files for the Ryu SDN controller's web-based topology 
             viewer. It provides a web interface to visualize and manage network topologies.

.. moduleauthor:: Ryu Project Contributors <ryu-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>

Introduction
------------

This module is designed to serve static files that are used by the Ryu SDN controllerâ€™s 
web-based topology viewer. It allows users to visualize and manage their network topologies 
through a web browser. Key features include:

- Serving static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files necessary for the web interface.
- Integration with other Ryu applications such as `rest_topology`, `ws_topology`, and `ofctl_rest` 
  to provide comprehensive network management capabilities.

Usage example
-------------

1. Join switches (use your favorite method):
$ sudo mn --controller remote --topo tree,depth=3

2. Run this application:
$ PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/ryu run \
    --observe-links ryu/app/gui_topology/gui_topology.py

3. Access http://<ip address of ryu host>:8080 with your web browser.
