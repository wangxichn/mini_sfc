## Version note

During the development of Mini-SFC, we have modified the simulation framework to different degrees through updated versions. When using the framework, please pay attention to the correspondence between different versions and the functions provided by them (especially the models, metrics, methods used in the paper). If you need past versions, please pay attention to the historical releases provided in the repository
